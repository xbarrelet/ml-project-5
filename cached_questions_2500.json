I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't <em>want</em> Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();\ntrace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));\n// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine\n// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine\n// Ah, young love!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the \"Empty Trash\" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.</p>\n\n<p>Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.</p>\n\n<p>I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?</p>\n",

This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of \"this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 1</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  $array[] = $item;\n}\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 2</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>\n\n<p>If we look in the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 3</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\n/* Output\n  array(4) {\n    [1]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [\"value\"]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [0]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n    [\"key\"]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n  }\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  bool(false)\n*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then <a href=\"http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>\n\n<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let's find out what that \"unexpected behavior\" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 4</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  each($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Test case 5</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  reset($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the \"copy of source\" theory.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that <code>foreach</code> works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is this correct and the whole story?</li>\n<li>If not, what is it really doing?</li>\n<li>Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (<code>each()</code>, <code>reset()</code> et al.) during a <code>foreach</code> could affect the outcome of the loop?</li>\n</ul>\n",

Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>\n<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li>\n<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>\n<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (without reopening the same file) and makes it faster.</li>\n<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers.</li>\n<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. &quot;on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp&quot;).</li>\n<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Questions:</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> &amp; <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li>\n<li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>?

        "body": "<p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">image processing</a>. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/irQtR.png\" alt=\"Template matching\"></p>\n\n<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>\n<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>\n<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>\n<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely \"too much\" on color detection).</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>\n<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Byw82.png\" alt=\"Total fail\"></p>\n\n<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=\"http://opencv.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenCV</a> library.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HSV</a> and filtering based on \"red\" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ktdAB.png\" alt=\"Binarized image\">  </li>\n<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F9319.png\" alt=\"Contour detection\"></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>\n<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>\n<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will \"learn\".</li>\n<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wxrT1.png\" alt=\"GHT\"></p>\n\n<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>\n<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>\n<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>\n<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>\n\n<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)</p>\n",

If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.

        "body": "<p>When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a <code>string</code> representing the name of the team, etc..</p>\n\n<p>So then I think:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a <code>string</code>) and a running total of scores (an <code>int</code>). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is <code>List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</code>, so I will inherit from it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; \n{ \n    public string TeamName; \n    public int RunningTotal \n}\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it turns out that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376343/1042555\">a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.</p>\n\n<h2>Why not?</h2>\n\n<p>Apparently <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376358/1042555\"><code>List</code> is somehow optimized for performance</a>. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend <code>List</code>? What exactly will break?</p>\n\n<p>Another reason I've seen is that <code>List</code> is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5376203/inherit-listt#comment6077237_5376343\">I cannot change it later, after exposing a \"public API\"</a>. But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from <code>List</code> <em>and</em> it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?</p>\n\n<p>Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from <code>List</code>, why didn't they make the class <code>sealed</code>?</p>\n\n<h2>What else am I supposed to use?</h2>\n\n<p>Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a <code>Collection</code> class which should be extended instead of <code>List</code>. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1474863/addrange-to-a-collection\">such as <code>AddRange</code></a>, for instance. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/12039943/1042555\">jvitor83's answer</a> provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow <code>AddRange</code> not better than no <code>AddRange</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Inheriting from <code>Collection</code> is way more work than inheriting from <code>List</code>, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting <code>Collection</code> is actually not the right solution for my problem.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen suggestions such as implementing <code>IList</code>. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, some suggest wrapping the <code>List</code> in something: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class FootballTeam \n{ \n    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are two problems with this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call <code>my_team.Players.Count</code> instead of just <code>my_team.Count</code>. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal <code>List</code>... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p></li>\n<li><p>It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't \"have\" a list of players. It <em>is</em> the list of players. You don't say \"John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players\". You say \"John has joined SomeTeam\". You don't add a letter to \"a string's characters\", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I realize that what happens \"under the hood\" can be said to be \"adding X to Y's internal list\", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.</p>\n\n<h2>My question (summarized)</h2>\n\n<p>What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, \"logically\" (that is to say, \"to the human mind\") is just a <code>list</code> of <code>things</code> with a few bells and whistles?</p>\n\n<p>Is inheriting from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or not?</p>\n",

Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 <code>popcount</code> intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is <code>unsigned</code>, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is <code>uint64_t</code>. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.</p>\n\n<h2>The (absolutely crazy) results</h2>\n\n<p>I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):</p>\n\n<pre><code>g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are the results on my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haswell</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29#Desktop_processors\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core i7-4770K</a> CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running <code>test 1</code> (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   <strong>26.113&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   <strong>13.8003&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you see, the throughput of the <code>uint64_t</code> version is <strong>only half</strong> the one of the <code>unsigned</code> version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried <code>clang++</code> (Ubuntu <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Clang</a> version 3.4-1ubuntu3):</p>\n\n<pre><code>clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Result: <code>test 1</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   <strong>26.3267 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   <strong>15.3986 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. <em>But now it gets super strange.</em> I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant <code>1</code>, so I change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for <code>g++</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   <strong>20.5944&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   <strong>20.6139&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the <code>unsigned</code> <strong>got even slower</strong>! It dropped from <code>26</code> to <code>20 GB/s</code>, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a <strong>deoptimization</strong>. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to <code>clang++</code> with the new version:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   <strong>15.4884&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   <strong>15.4906&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em> Now, both versions dropped to the <strong>slow</strong> number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in <strong>both</strong> cases for Clang!</p>\n\n<p>I asked a colleague with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ivy Bridge</a> CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.</p>\n\n<h2>More madness, please!</h2>\n\n<p>Take the first example (the one with <code>atol(argv[1])</code>) and put a <code>static</code> before the variable, i.e.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are my results in g++:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   <strong>26.4306 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   <strong>20.5811 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Yay, yet another alternative</em>. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with <code>u32</code>, but we managed to get <code>u64</code> at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! <strong>On my collegue's PC, the <code>u64</code> version became even faster than the <code>u32</code> version, yielding the fastest result of all.</strong> Sadly, this only works for <code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code> does not seem to care about <code>static</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>My question</h2>\n\n<p>Can you explain these results? Especially:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can there be such a difference between <code>u32</code> and <code>u64</code>?</li>\n<li>How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger <em>less optimal code</em>?</li>\n<li>How can the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword make the <code>u64</code> loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a <strong>100% difference</strong> in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?</p>\n\n<h2>The Disassembly</h2>\n\n<p>Here is the disassembly for the various results:</p>\n\n<p>26&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>g++ / u32 / non-const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400af8:\nlea 0x1(%rdx),%eax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rax,8),%r9\nlea 0x2(%rdx),%edi\npopcnt (%rbx,%rcx,8),%rax\nlea 0x3(%rdx),%esi\nadd %r9,%rax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdi,8),%rcx\nadd $0x4,%edx\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rsi,8),%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rax\nmov %edx,%ecx\nadd %rax,%r14\ncmp %rbp,%rcx\njb 0x400af8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>13&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>g++ / u64 / non-const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400c00:\npopcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdx,8),%rax\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\nadd $0x4,%rdx\nadd %rcx,%rax\nadd %rax,%r12\ncmp %rbp,%rdx\njb 0x400c00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>15&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>clang++ / u64 / non-const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400e50:\npopcnt (%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rbx,%rdx\npopcnt 0x8(%r15,%rcx,8),%rsi\nadd %rdx,%rsi\npopcnt 0x10(%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rdx\npopcnt 0x18(%r15,%rcx,8),%rbx\nadd %rdx,%rbx\nadd $0x4,%rcx\ncmp %rbp,%rcx\njb 0x400e50\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>20&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>g++ / u32&amp;u64 / const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400a68:\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax\npopcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rcx\nadd %rax,%rcx\npopcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax\nadd %rax,%rcx\npopcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rsi\nadd $0x20,%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rbp\ncmp $0x100000,%rdx\njne 0x400a68\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>15&nbsp;GB/s version from <strong>clang++ / u32&amp;u64 / const bufsize</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0x400dd0:\npopcnt (%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rbx,%rdx\npopcnt 0x8(%r14,%rcx,8),%rsi\nadd %rdx,%rsi\npopcnt 0x10(%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rdx\npopcnt 0x18(%r14,%rcx,8),%rbx\nadd %rdx,%rbx\nadd $0x4,%rcx\ncmp $0x20000,%rcx\njb 0x400dd0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses <code>lea</code>. Some versions use <code>jb</code> to jump, others use <code>jne</code>. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?</p>\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n<p>No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops <em>every</em> detail can matter, <em>even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code</em>. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a <em>100%</em> difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.</p>\n",

I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.\nI am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Information for Bounty</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.</p>\n\n<p>In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  </p>\n\n<p>In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks to Everyone</strong></p>\n\n<p>This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.</p>\n\n<p>As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>First of all, some definitions:</p>\n<p>PUT is defined in <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Section 9.6 RFC 2616</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity <strong>SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server</strong>. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PATCH is defined in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RFC 5789</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The PATCH method requests that <strong>a set of changes</strong> described in the\nrequest entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-\nURI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also according to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2</a> PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.</p>\n<p>Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to <code>/users</code> with the data <code>{username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code> and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume <code>/users/1</code>) and any next call to GET <code>/users/1</code> will return <code>{id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code>.</p>\n<p>Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered &quot;a set of changes&quot; and therefore I should PATCH <code>/users/1</code> with &quot;<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789#section-2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">patch document</a>&quot;. In my case it would be the JSON document: <code>{email: 'skwee357@newdomain.example'}</code>. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of &quot;patching&quot; or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to <strong>replace</strong> entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. <code>/users</code> to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "body": "<p>I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q1</strong>: We have a bag containing numbers <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, …, <code>100</code>. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A1</strong>: Well, the sum of the numbers <code>1 + 2 + 3 + … + N</code> is <code>(N+1)(N/2)</code> (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_sum#Sum\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series</a>). For <code>N = 100</code>, the sum is <code>5050</code>.</p>\n<p>Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly <code>5050</code>. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in <code>O(N)</code> time and <code>O(1)</code> space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q2</strong>: That is correct, but now how would you do this if <em>TWO</em> numbers are missing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.</p>\n<p>The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.</p>\n<p>The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find <em>k</em> missing numbers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Qk</strong>: If exactly <em>k</em> numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a <code>Ω(N)</code> time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the <em>TIME</em> and <em>SPACE</em> complexity of the solving technique (minus the <code>O(N)</code> time input scan) is defined in <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>.</p>\n<p>So the question here is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How would you solve <strong>Q2</strong>?</li>\n<li>How would you solve <strong>Q3</strong>?</li>\n<li>How would you solve <strong>Qk</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>Clarifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally there are <em>N</em> numbers from 1..<em>N</em>, not just 1..100.</li>\n<li>I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bit set</a>, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using <code>O(N)</code> bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to <em>N</em>.</li>\n<li>I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on <em>N</em>, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So again, of course you must scan the input in <code>O(N)</code>, but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>), and must then find the <em>k</em> missing numbers somehow.</p>\n",

I've spent days trying to fully wrap my head around suffix tree construction, but because I don't have a mathematical background, many of the explanations elude me as they start to make excessive use of mathematical symbology. The closest to a good explanation that I've found is <em><a href=\"https://marknelson.us/posts/1996/08/01/suffix-trees.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fast String Searching With Suffix Trees</a></em>, but he glosses over various points and some aspects of the algorithm remain unclear.</p>\n<p>A step-by-step explanation of this algorithm here on Stack Overflow would be invaluable for many others besides me, I'm sure.</p>\n<p>For reference, here's Ukkonen's paper on the algorithm: <a href=\"http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf</a></p>\n<p>My basic understanding, so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I need to iterate through each prefix P of a given string T</li>\n<li>I need to iterate through each suffix S in prefix P and add that to tree</li>\n<li>To add suffix S to the tree, I need to iterate through each character in S, with the iterations consisting of either walking down an existing branch that starts with the same set of characters C in S and potentially splitting an edge into descendent nodes when I reach a differing character in the suffix, OR if there was no matching edge to walk down. When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basic algorithm appears to be O(n<sup>2</sup>), as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix. Ukkonen's algorithm is apparently unique because of the suffix pointer technique he uses, though I think <em>that</em> is what I'm having trouble understanding.</p>\n<p>I'm also having trouble understanding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exactly when and how the &quot;active point&quot; is assigned, used and changed</li>\n<li>what is going on with the canonization aspect of the algorithm</li>\n<li>Why the implementations I've seen need to &quot;fix&quot; bounding variables that they are using</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is the completed <strong>C#</strong> source code. It not only works correctly, but supports automatic canonization and renders a nicer looking text graph of the output. Source code and sample output is at:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/2373868\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://gist.github.com/2373868</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update 2017-11-04</strong></p>\n<p>After many years I've found a new use for suffix trees, and have implemented the algorithm in <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Gist is below. It should be bug-free. Dump it into a js file, <code>npm install chalk</code> from the same location, and then run with node.js to see some colourful output. There's a stripped down version in the same Gist, without any of the debugging code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/axefrog/c347bf0f5e0723cbd09b1aaed6ec6fc6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://gist.github.com/axefrog/c347bf0f5e0723cbd09b1aaed6ec6fc6</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about \"big data\" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought is to use <code>HDFStore</code> to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:</p>\n\n<p>What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure</li>\n<li>Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure</li>\n<li>Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on \"large data\".</p>\n\n<p>Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.</li>\n<li>In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.</li>\n<li>I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.</li>\n<li>I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.</li>\n<li>Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, <code>if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'</code>.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.</li>\n<li>Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.</li>\n<li>A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.</li>\n<li>It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.</li>\n<li>The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).</p>\n",

For instance, imagine a function called something like:</p>\n<pre><code>getNewRecordID(intRecordType)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.</p>\n<p>Must be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.

        "body": "<p>I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.</p>\n<p>I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BuUbq.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UyNRU.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?</p>\n<p><strong>Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!</strong></p>\n<p>Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.</p>\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"https://upl.io/0liy07\" rel=\"noreferrer\">version that can be loaded with <code>np.loadtxt</code></a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.</p>\n<p>More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.</p>\n<p>Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FFX0x.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.</p>\n<p>This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iPXEv.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.flipserd.com/blog/ivoflipse/post/toe-detection-revisited\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I have set up a blog for anyone interested</a></strong> and <a href=\"https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjVZ_ROiXWgOhDEn4KrRB8mrOZWM?e=aUCCm4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements.</a> So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>New update:</h2>\n<p>So after the help I got with my questions regarding <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/4087919/77595\">paw detection</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/4502656/77595\">paw sorting</a>, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.</p>\n<p>Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JEpIa.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"http://www.flipserd.com/blog/ivoflipse/post/toe-detection-revisited\" rel=\"noreferrer\">trying the current solution on all my measurements</a> I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!</p>\n<p>So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the <code>neighborhood</code> to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But <code>generate_binary_structure</code> wouldn't let me change the size of the array.</p>\n<p>Anyone has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?</p>\n",

    {
        "body": "<p>I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 1000000\nvar x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)\nfor i in 0..&lt;n {\n    x[i] = random()\n}\n// start clock here\nlet y = sort(x)\n// stop clock here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In C++, a similar operation takes <strong>0.06s</strong> on my computer.</p>\n\n<p>In Python, it takes <strong>0.6s</strong> (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).</p>\n\n<p>In Swift it takes <strong>6s</strong> if I compile it with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it takes as much as <strong>88s</strong> if I compile it with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Timings in Xcode with \"Release\" vs. \"Debug\" builds are similar.</p>\n\n<p>What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> weather noticed that changing <code>-O3</code> to <code>-Ofast</code> makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, <code>-Ofast</code> changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it <strong>disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows</strong>. For example, with <code>-Ofast</code> the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 10000000\nprint(n*n*n*n*n)\nlet x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)\nprint(x[n])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <code>-Ofast</code> is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got <code>-ftrapv</code> for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of</p>\n\n<pre><code>for i in 0..&lt;n {\n    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also \"harmless\" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)</p>\n\n<p>Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between <code>-O3</code> and <code>-Ofast</code>. So I had a look at the assembly code:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>With <code>-Ofast</code> I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.</p></li>\n<li><p>With <code>-O3</code> I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_retain\" and another 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_release\". That is, <strong>26 subroutine calls in the inner loop</strong>!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 10000\nvar x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)\nfor i in 0..&lt;n {\n    for j in 0..&lt;n {\n        x[i] = x[j]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>C++ -O3: <strong>0.05 s</strong></li>\n<li>C++ -O0: 0.4 s</li>\n<li>Java: <strong>0.2 s</strong></li>\n<li>Python with PyPy: 0.5 s</li>\n<li>Python: <strong>12 s</strong></li>\n<li>Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s</li>\n<li>Swift -O3: <strong>23 s</strong></li>\n<li>Swift -O0: 443 s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. <code>x[i] ^= x[j]</code>, and add a print statement that outputs <code>x[0]</code>. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)</p>\n\n<p>And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be <strong>much</strong> slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.</p>\n\n<p>For sorting, I now have the following timings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clang++ -O3: 0.06 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -O: 0.1 s</li>\n<li>swiftc: 4 s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For nested loops:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clang++ -O3: 0.06 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s</li>\n<li>swiftc -O: 0.4 s</li>\n<li>swiftc: 540 s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe <code>-Ofast</code> (a.k.a. <code>-Ounchecked</code>); plain <code>-O</code> produces equally good code.</p>\n",

This means the rendering\nthread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the\nstyles it needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My actual testing reveals something quite different:</p>\n<h3>My test harness</h3>\n<p>I use the following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ruby</a> script to generate specific delays for various resources:</p>\n<pre><code>require 'rubygems'\nrequire 'eventmachine'\nrequire 'evma_httpserver'\nrequire 'date'\n\nclass Handler  &lt; EventMachine::Connection\n  include EventMachine::HttpServer\n\n  def process_http_request\n    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )\n\n    return unless @http_query_string\n\n    path = @http_path_info\n    array = @http_query_string.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;).map{|s| s.split(&quot;=&quot;)}.flatten\n    parsed = Hash[*array]\n\n    delay = parsed[&quot;delay&quot;].to_i / 1000.0\n    jsdelay = parsed[&quot;jsdelay&quot;].to_i\n\n    delay = 5 if (delay &gt; 5)\n    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay &gt; 5000)\n\n    delay = 0 if (delay &lt; 0)\n    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay &lt; 0)\n\n    # Block which fulfills the request\n    operation = proc do\n      sleep delay\n\n      if path.match(/.js$/)\n        resp.status = 200\n        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/javascript&quot;\n        resp.content = &quot;(function(){\n            var start = new Date();\n            while(new Date() - start &lt; #{jsdelay}){}\n          })();&quot;\n      end\n      if path.match(/.css$/)\n        resp.status = 200\n        resp.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;text/css&quot;\n        resp.content = &quot;body {font-size: 50px;}&quot;\n      end\n    end\n\n    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled\n    callback = proc do |res|\n        resp.send_response\n    end\n\n    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request\n    EM.defer(operation, callback)\n  end\nend\n\nEventMachine::run {\n  EventMachine::start_server(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 8081, Handler)\n  puts &quot;Listening...&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, <code>http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500</code> gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS.</p>\n<p>I use the following page to test.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;test&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n          var startTime = new Date();\n      &lt;/script&gt;\n      &lt;link href=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://10.0.0.50:8081/test2.js?delay=400&amp;amp;jsdelay=1000&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Elapsed time is:\n      &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n        document.write(new Date() - startTime);\n      &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZDgrs.png\" alt=\"CSS first\" /></p>\n<p>When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5o5SG.png\" alt=\"JavaScript first\" /></p>\n<p>I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_%28web_browser%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Opera</a>, however, the ordering simply does not matter.</p>\n<p>What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.</p>\n<p>Am I missing something? Is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?</p>\n<p><sub>It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.</sub></p>\n",

Am I running any risk by using the <code>new Array()</code> syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?</p>\n\n<p>And second, if I switch to the square bracket syntax, is there any way to declare an array and set its length all on one line, or do I have to do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var test = [];\ntest.length = 4;\n</code></pre>\n",

        "body": "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>I'm relatively familiar with <code>data.table</code>, not so much with <code>dplyr</code>.  I've read through some <a href=\"http://rpubs.com/hadley/dplyr-intro\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>dplyr</code> vignettes</a> and examples that have popped up on SO, and so far my conclusions are that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>data.table</code> and <code>dplyr</code> are comparable in speed, except when there are many (i.e. &gt;10-100K) groups, and in some other circumstances (see benchmarks below)</li>\n<li><code>dplyr</code> has more accessible syntax</li>\n<li><code>dplyr</code> abstracts (or will) potential DB interactions</li>\n<li>There are some minor functionality differences (see &quot;Examples/Usage&quot; below)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In my mind 2. doesn't bear much weight because I am fairly familiar with <code>data.table</code>, though I understand that for users new to both it will be a big factor.  I would like to avoid an argument about which is more intuitive, as that is irrelevant for my specific question asked from the perspective of someone already familiar with <code>data.table</code>.  I also would like to avoid a discussion about how &quot;more intuitive&quot; leads to faster analysis (certainly true, but again, not what I'm most interested about here).</p>\n<h3>Question</h3>\n<p>What I want to know is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are there analytical tasks that are a lot easier to code with one or the other package for people familiar with the packages (i.e. some combination of keystrokes required vs. required level of esotericism, where less of each is a good thing).</li>\n<li>Are there analytical tasks that are performed substantially (i.e. more than 2x) more efficiently in one package vs. another.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21421004/how-to-cumulatively-add-values-in-one-vector-in-r\">recent SO question</a> got me thinking about this a bit more, because up until that point I didn't think <code>dplyr</code> would offer much beyond what I can already do in <code>data.table</code>.  Here is the <code>dplyr</code> solution (data at end of Q):</p>\n<pre><code>dat %.%\n  group_by(name, job) %.%\n  filter(job != &quot;Boss&quot; | year == min(year)) %.%\n  mutate(cumu_job2 = cumsum(job2))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which was much better than my hack attempt at a <code>data.table</code> solution.  That said, good <code>data.table</code> solutions are also pretty good (thanks Jean-Robert, Arun, and note here I favored single statement over the strictly most optimal solution):</p>\n<pre><code>setDT(dat)[,\n  .SD[job != &quot;Boss&quot; | year == min(year)][, cumjob := cumsum(job2)], \n  by=list(id, job)\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The syntax for the latter may seem very esoteric, but it actually is pretty straightforward if you're used to <code>data.table</code> (i.e. doesn't use some of the more esoteric tricks).</p>\n<p>Ideally what I'd like to see is some good examples were the <code>dplyr</code> or <code>data.table</code> way is substantially more concise or performs substantially better.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>dplyr</code> does not allow grouped operations that return arbitrary number of rows (from <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21737815/grouped-operations-that-result-in-length-not-equal-to-1-or-length-of-group-in-dp\">eddi's question</a></strong>, note: this looks like it will be implemented in <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/issues/154\" rel=\"noreferrer\">dplyr 0.5</a></strong>, also, @beginneR shows a potential work-around using <code>do</code> in the answer to @eddi's question).</li>\n<li><code>data.table</code> supports <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12030932/rolling-joins-data-table-in-r\">rolling joins</a></strong> (thanks @dholstius) as well as <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23371747/range-join-data-frames-specific-date-column-with-date-ranges-intervals-in-r/23377309#23377309\">overlap joins</a></strong></li>\n<li><code>data.table</code> internally optimises expressions of the form <code>DT[col == value]</code> or <code>DT[col %in% values]</code> for <em>speed</em> through <em>automatic indexing</em> which uses <em>binary search</em> while using the same base R syntax. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/arunsrinivasan/dacb9d1cac301de8d9ff\" rel=\"noreferrer\">See here</a> for some more details and a tiny benchmark.</li>\n<li><code>dplyr</code> offers standard evaluation versions of functions (e.g. <code>regroup</code>, <code>summarize_each_</code>) that can simplify the programmatic use of <code>dplyr</code> (note programmatic use of <code>data.table</code> is definitely possible, just requires some careful thought, substitution/quoting, etc, at least to my knowledge)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Benchmarks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I ran <strong><a href=\"https://www.brodieg.com/2014/04/18/datatable-vs-dplyr-in-split-apply-comgine/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my own benchmarks</a></strong> and found both packages to be comparable in &quot;split apply combine&quot; style analysis, except when there are very large numbers of groups (&gt;100K) at which point <code>data.table</code> becomes substantially faster.</li>\n<li>@Arun ran some <strong><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/arunsrinivasan/db6e1ce05227f120a2c9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">benchmarks on joins</a></strong>, showing that <code>data.table</code> scales better than <code>dplyr</code> as the number of groups increase (updated with recent enhancements in both packages and recent version of R).

When user pushes the button, the field gets populated with data from a remote server.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GBI59.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GBI59.png\" alt=\"A field and a button\"></a></p>\n\n<pre><code>import * as React from 'react';\nimport * as Redux from 'redux';\nimport { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';\n\nconst ActionTypes = {\n    STARTED_UPDATING: 'STARTED_UPDATING',\n    UPDATED: 'UPDATED'\n};\n\nclass AsyncApi {\n    static getFieldValue() {\n        const promise = new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n            setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n                resolve(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));\n            }, 1000);\n        });\n        return promise;\n    }\n}\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            &lt;div&gt;\n                &lt;input value={this.props.field}/&gt;\n                &lt;button disabled={this.props.isWaiting} onClick={this.props.update}&gt;Fetch&lt;/button&gt;\n                {this.props.isWaiting &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;Waiting...&lt;/div&gt;}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        );\n    }\n}\nApp.propTypes = {\n    dispatch: React.PropTypes.func,\n    field: React.PropTypes.any,\n    isWaiting: React.PropTypes.bool\n};\n\nconst reducer = (state = { field: 'No data', isWaiting: false }, action) =&gt; {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        case ActionTypes.STARTED_UPDATING:\n            return { ...state, isWaiting: true };\n        case ActionTypes.UPDATED:\n            return { ...state, isWaiting: false, field: action.payload };\n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n};\nconst store = Redux.createStore(reducer);\nconst ConnectedApp = connect(\n    (state) =&gt; {\n        return { ...state };\n    },\n    (dispatch) =&gt; {\n        return {\n            update: () =&gt; {\n                dispatch({\n                    type: ActionTypes.STARTED_UPDATING\n                });\n                AsyncApi.getFieldValue()\n                    .then(result =&gt; dispatch({\n                        type: ActionTypes.UPDATED,\n                        payload: result\n                    }));\n            }\n        };\n    })(App);\nexport default class extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;&lt;ConnectedApp/&gt;&lt;/Provider&gt;;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the exported component is rendered, I can click the button and the input is updated correctly. </p>\n\n<p>Note the <code>update</code> function in the <code>connect</code> call. It dispatches an action that tells the App that it is updating, and then performs an async call. After the call finishes, the provided value is dispatched as a payload of another action.</p>\n\n<p>What is wrong with this approach? Why would I want to use Redux Thunk or Redux Promise, as the documentation suggests?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I searched the Redux repo for clues, and found that Action Creators were required to be pure functions in the past. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/533\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here's a user trying to provide a better explanation for async data flow:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The action creator itself is still a pure function, but the thunk function it returns doesn't need to be, and it can do our async calls</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1088\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Action creators are no longer required to be pure.</a> So, thunk/promise middleware was definitely required in the past, but it seems that this is no longer the case?</p>\n",

Often, I want to quickly get an impression of the scale and complexity of a project, and the count of lines of code can give a good first impression. 500 lines of code implies a relatively simple project, 100,000 lines of code implies a very large/complicated project.</p>\n\n<p>So, is it possible to get the lines of code written in the various languages from a GitHub repository, preferably without cloning it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The question “<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/4822471/388916\">Count number of lines in a git repository</a>” asks how to count the lines of code in a local Git repository, but:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You have to clone the project, which could be massive. Cloning a project like Wine, for example, takes ages.</li>\n<li>You would count lines in files that wouldn’t necessarily be code, like i13n files.</li>\n<li>If you count <em>just</em> (for example) Ruby files, you’d potentially miss massive amount of code in other languages, like JavaScript. You’d have to know beforehand which languages the project uses. You’d also have to repeat the count for every language the project uses.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All in all, this is potentially far too time-intensive for “quickly checking the scale of a project”.</p>\n",

When we do changes, we create a branch off dev:</p>\n<pre><code>git checkout -b FixForBug origin/dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I have a branch called <code>FixForBug</code> which is tracking (I think that's the right word) <code>origin/dev</code>.  Thus, if I do a <code>git pull</code> it'll bring in new changes from <code>origin/dev</code> which is great.  Now, when I'm finished with my fix, I push to a remote branch called the same thing.</p>\n<p>First I pull down any changes from <code>origin/dev</code> and do a rebase:</p>\n<pre><code>git pull --rebase\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I push the changes to a remote branch of the same name:</p>\n<pre><code>git push origin FixForBug\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, there's a branch on the remote server and I can create a pull request for that change to be approved and merged back in to the dev branch.  I don't <em>ever</em> push anything to <code>origin/dev</code> myself.  I'm guessing this is as pretty common workflow.</p>\n<p>The first time I do a <code>git push</code>, it works fine and creates the remote branch.  However, if I push a <em>second</em> time (let's say during code-review, someone points out a problem), I get the following error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>error: failed to push some refs to\n'https://github.mydomain.info/Product/product.git'<br />\nhint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.<br />\nSee the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if I do a <code>git status</code> it says I'm ahead of <code>origin/dev</code> by 1 commit (which makes sense) and if I follow the hint and run <code>git pull</code>, it says everything is up to date.  I <em>think</em> this is because I'm pushing to a different branch than my upstream branch.  I can fix this issue by running:</p>\n<p><code>git push -f origin FixForBug</code></p>\n<p>In that case, it'll push the changes to the remote branch, saying <em>(forced update)</em> and everything <em>appears</em> to be good on the remote branch.</p>\n<p><strong>My Questions:</strong></p>\n<p>Why is <code>-f</code> required in this scenario?  Usually when you're <em>forcing</em> something, it's because you were doing something wrong or at least against standard practice.  Am I ok doing this, or will it mess up something in the remote branch or create a hassle for whoever has to eventually merge my stuff into dev?</p>\n",

I rarely created a <code>ListFragment</code> or other UI that can be reused several times.</p>\n<p>Recently I stumbled on a project that contains only 2 <code>Activities</code> one is a <code>SettingsActivity</code> and other one is the <code>MainActivity</code>. The layout of the <code>MainActivity</code> is populated with many hidden full screen UI fragments and only one is shown. In the <code>Activity</code> logic there are many <code>FragmentTransitions</code> between the different screens of the application.</p>\n<p>What I like about this approach is that because the application uses an <code>ActionBar</code>, it stays intact and does not move with the screen switching animation, which is what happens with <code>Activity</code> switching. This give a more fluent feel to those screen transitions.</p>\n<p>So I guess what I'm asking is to share your current development manner regarding this topic, I know it might look like an opinion based question at first look but I look at it as an Android design and architecture question... Not really an opinion based one.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE (01.05.2014):</strong> Following this presentation by <strong>Eric Burke</strong> from <strong>Square</strong>, (which I have to say is a great presentation with a lot of useful tools for android developers. And I am not related in any way to Square)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Android-Design/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Android-Design/</a></p>\n<p>From my personal experience over the past few months, I found that the best way to construct my applications is to create groups of fragments that come to represent a <strong>flow</strong> in the application and present all those fragments in one <code>Activity</code>. So basically you will have the same number of <code>Activities</code> in your application as the number of flows.\nThat way the action bar stays intact on all the flow's screens, but is being recreated on changing a flow which makes a lot of sense. As Eric Burke states and as I have come to realize as well, the philosophy of using as few <code>Activities</code> as possible is not applicable for all situations because it creates a mess in what he calls the &quot;God&quot; activity.</p>\n",

Replace seemed like a better choice (as per <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4530069/python-how-to-get-a-value-of-datetime-today-that-is-timezone-aware\">How do I get a value of datetime.today() in Python that is &quot;timezone aware&quot;?</a>):</p>\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; unaware.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=&lt;UTC&gt;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unaware == aware\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n</code></pre>\n<p>But as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware.  I'm getting ready to fall back to doctoring the input string to have a timezone before parsing it (I'm using dateutil for parsing, if that matters), but that seems incredibly kludgy.</p>\n<p>Also, I've tried this in both Python 2.6 and Python 2.7, with the same results.</p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong></p>\n<p>I am writing a parser for some data files. There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator. I've already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format. A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons. While in general, I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone, in this case it seems like the best option. I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC, so I'm prepared to accept the risk of defaulting to that in this case.</p>\n",

Many older Maven POMs still declare a dependency on <code>xerces.jar</code>.  At some point in the past, Xerces was also released as <code>xmlParserAPIs.jar</code>, which some older POMs also depend on.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The versions assigned to the xml-apis and xercesImpl jars by those who deploy their jars to Maven repositories are often different.  For example, xml-apis might be given version 1.3.03 and xercesImpl might be given version 2.8.0, even though both are from Xerces 2.8.0.  This is because people often tag the xml-apis jar with the version of the specifications that it implements.  There is a very nice, but incomplete breakdown of this <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140113103608/http://swordsystems.com/2011/06/29/xerces-and-xml-api-dependency-hell/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To complicate matters, Xerces is the XML parser used in the reference implementation of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), included in the JRE. The implementation classes are repackaged under the <code>com.sun.*</code> namespace, which makes it dangerous to access them directly, as they may not be available in some JREs.  However, not all of the Xerces functionality is exposed via the <code>java.*</code> and <code>javax.*</code> APIs; for example, there is no API that exposes Xerces serialization.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Adding to the confusing mess, almost all servlet containers (JBoss, Jetty, Glassfish, Tomcat, etc.), ship with Xerces in one or more of their <code>/lib</code> folders.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Problems</h1>\n<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>\n<p>For some -- or perhaps all -- of the reasons above, many\norganizations publish and consume custom builds of Xerces in their\nPOMs.  This is not really a problem if you have a small application and are only using Maven Central, but it quickly becomes an issue for enterprise software where Artifactory or Nexus is proxying multiple repositories (JBoss, Hibernate, etc.):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Fe9Xa.png\" alt=\"xml-apis proxied by Artifactory\" /></p>\n<p>For example, organization A might publish <code>xml-apis</code> as:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.xerces&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;2.9.1&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Meanwhile, organization B might publish the same <code>jar</code> as:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;1.3.04&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Although B's <code>jar</code> is a lower version than A's <code>jar</code>, Maven does not know\nthat they are the same artifact because they have different\n<code>groupId</code>s. Thus, it cannot perform conflict resolution and both\n<code>jar</code>s will be included as resolved dependencies:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4X1ts.png\" alt=\"resolved dependencies with multiple xml-apis\" /></p>\n<h3>Classloader Hell</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the JRE ships with Xerces in the JAXP RI.  While it would be nice to mark all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>s or as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code>, the third-party code you depend on may or may not work with the version provided in JAXP of the JDK you're using.  In addition, you have the Xerces jars shipped in your servlet container to contend with. This leaves you with a number of choices: Do you delete the servlet version and hope that your container runs on the JAXP version? Is it better to leave the servlet version, and hope that your application frameworks run on the servlet version? If one or two of the unresolved conflicts outlined above manage to slip into your product (easy to happen in a large organization), you quickly find yourself in classloader hell, wondering which version of Xerces the classloader is picking at runtime and whether or not it will pick the same jar in Windows and Linux (probably not).</p>\n<h1>Solutions?</h1>\n<p>We've tried marking all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code> or as an <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>, but this is difficult to enforce (especially with a large team) given that the artifacts have so many aliases (<code>xml-apis</code>, <code>xerces</code>, <code>xercesImpl</code>, <code>xmlParserAPIs</code>, etc.).  Additionally, our third party libs/frameworks may not run on the JAXP version or the version provided by a servlet container.</p>\n<p><strong>How can we best address this problem with Maven?  Do we have to exercise such fine-grained control over our dependencies, and then rely on tiered classloading?  Is there some way to globally exclude all Xerces dependencies, and force all of our frameworks/libs to use the JAXP version?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Joshua Spiewak has uploaded a patched version of the Xerces build scripts to <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454\" rel=\"noreferrer\">XERCESJ-1454</a> that allows for upload to Maven Central.  Vote/watch/contribute to this issue and let's fix this problem once and for all.</p>\n",

However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: \"Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'\", <em>BUT</em> Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too).</p>\n\n<p>So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (\"Go To Declaration\") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the \"Projects\" window the \"com.hunnysoft.jmime\" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under \"Libraries\".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK).</p>\n\n<p>As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0\nAnt-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.4\nCreated-By: 10.0-b23 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)\n\nName: com/hunnysoft/jmime/\nSealed: true\nSpecification-Title: Hunny JMIME\nSpecification-Version: 3.1.1\nSpecification-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.\nImplementation-Title: com.hunnysoft.jmime\nImplementation-Version: 3.1.1E\nImplementation-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't see anything unusual in this jar file.</p>\n\n<p>My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing).</p>\n\n<p>So, anyone have any IDEAs?</p>\n",

It's like we plug something into something else. He mentioned an example about EJB 2.0:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example the Session Bean interface\n  defines ejbRemove, ejbPassivate\n  (stored to secondary storage), and\n  ejbActivate (restored from passive\n  state). You don't get to control when\n  these methods are called, just what\n  they do. The container calls us, we\n  don't call it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This leads to the difference between framework and library:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inversion of Control is a key part of\n  what makes a framework different to a\n  library. A library is essentially a\n  set of functions that you can call,\n  these days usually organized into\n  classes. Each call does some work and\n  returns control to the client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think, the point of view that DI is IOC, means the dependency of an object is inverted: instead of it controlling its own dependencies, life cycle... something else does it for you. But, as you told me about DI by hands, DI is not necessarily IOC. We can still have DI and no IOC.</p>\n\n<p>However, in this paper (from the pococapsule, another IOC Framework for C/C++), it suggests that because of IOC and DI, the IOC containers and DI frameworks are far more superior to J2EE, since J2EE mixes the framework code into the components, thus not making it Plain Old Java/C++ Object (POJO/POCO).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110715101402/http://www.pocomatic.com/docs/whitepapers/ioc-vs-di/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Inversion of Control Containers other than the Dependency Injection pattern</strong></a> (Archive link)</p>\n\n<p>Additional reading to understand what's the problem with old Component-Based Development Framework, which leads to the second paper above: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110715095758/http://www.pocomatic.com/docs/whitepapers/ioc/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Why and what of Inversion of Control</strong></a> (Archive link)</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Question</strong>: What exactly is IOC and DI?

Recently I've developed an application using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Groovy</a> and Java. All through the code I wrote used quite a good number of statics. I was asked by the senior technical lot to cut down on the number of statics used. I've googled about the same, and I find that many programmers are fairly against using static variables.</p>\n<p>I find static variables more convenient to use. And I presume that they are efficient too (please correct me if I am wrong), because if I had to make 10,000 calls to a function within a class, I would be glad to make the method static and use a straightforward <code>Class.methodCall()</code> on it instead of cluttering the memory with 10,000 instances of the class, right?</p>\n<p>Moreover statics reduce the inter-dependencies on the other parts of the code. They can act as perfect state holders. Adding to this I find that statics are widely implemented in some languages like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Smalltalk</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Scala</a>.

In the Django world (where I come from), the common practise would be to have a <code>settings.py</code> file containing the standard settings (timezone, etc), and then a <code>local_settings.py</code> for deployment specific settings, ie. what database to talk to, what memcache socket, e-mail address for the admins and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I have been looking for similar patterns for Node. Just a config file would be nice, so it does not have to be jammed in with everything else in <code>app.js</code>, but I find it important to have a way to have server-specific configuration in a file that is not in source control. The same app could well be deployed across different servers with wildly different settings, and having to deal with merge conflicts and all that is not my idea of fun.</p>\n\n<p>So is there some kind of framework/tool for this, or does everyone just hack something together themselves?</p>\n",

Due to pipelining, one can get a throughput of one <code>add</code> per cycle, if the algorithm has at least three independent summations. Since that is true for both packed <code>addpd</code> as well as the scalar <code>addsd</code> versions and SSE registers can contain two <code>double</code>'s, the throughput can be as much as two flops per cycle.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it seems (although I've not seen any proper documentation on this) <code>add</code>'s and <code>mul</code>'s can be executed in parallel giving a theoretical max throughput of four flops per cycle.</p>\n<p>However, I've not been able to replicate that performance with a simple C/C++ programme.

This works as expected if I use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, I am leery of using \"this\" as a context due to the potential for memory leaks when Activity is destroyed and recreated even during something simple like a screen rotation.

The most obvious one is to avoid escaping the context outside of its own scope. The example above showed the case of a static reference but inner classes and their implicit reference to the outer class can be equally dangerous. The second solution is to use the Application context. This context will live as long as your application is alive and does not depend on the activities life cycle. If you plan on keeping long-lived objects that need a context, remember the application object. You can obtain it easily by calling Context.getApplicationContext() or Activity.getApplication().</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But for the <code>AlertDialog()</code> neither <code>getApplicationContext()</code> or <code>getApplication()</code> is acceptable as a Context, as it throws the exception: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Unable to add window — token null is not for an application”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>per references: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1561803/android-progressdialog-show-crashes-with-getapplicationcontext\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2634991/android-1-6-android-view-windowmanagerbadtokenexception-unable-to-add-window\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/7a648edddccf6f7d\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3</a>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So, should this really be considered a \"bug\", since we are officially advised to use <code>Activity.getApplication()</code> and yet it doesn't function as advertised?</p>\n\n<p>Jim</p>\n",

This is because a <code>std::string</code> has various components including a pointer into the heap and a member <code>char[]</code> for short string optimization.

This property is referred to as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">referential transparency</a> of an expression.</p>\n\n<p>As Wikipedia says (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link</a>),</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can a time function (which returns the <em>current</em> time) exist in functional programming?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If yes, then how can it exist? Does it not violate the principle of functional programming? It particularly violates <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">referential transparency</a> which is one of the property of functional programming (if I correctly understand it).</p></li>\n<li><p>Or if no, then how can one know the current time in functional programming?</p></li>\n</ul>\n",

        "body": "<p>I've read on many Web sites Optional should be used as a return type only, and not used in method arguments.  I'm struggling to find a logical reason why.  For example I have a piece of logic which has 2 optional parameters.  Therefore I think it would make sense to write my method signature like this (solution 1):</p>\n<pre><code>public int calculateSomething(Optional&lt;String&gt; p1, Optional&lt;BigDecimal&gt; p2) {\n    // my logic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many web pages specify Optional should not be used as method arguments. With this in mind, I could use the following method signature and add a clear Javadoc comment to specify that the arguments may be null, hoping future maintainers will read the Javadoc and therefore always carry out null checks prior to using the arguments (solution 2):</p>\n<pre><code>public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {\n    // my logic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively I could replace my method with four public methods to provide a nicer interface and make it more obvious p1 and p2 are optional (solution 3):</p>\n<pre><code>public int calculateSomething() {\n    calculateSomething(null, null);\n}\n\npublic int calculateSomething(String p1) {\n    calculateSomething(p1, null);\n}\n\npublic int calculateSomething(BigDecimal p2) {\n    calculateSomething(null, p2);\n}\n\npublic int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {\n    // my logic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I try writing the code of the class which invokes this piece of logic for each approach.  I first retrieve the two input parameters from another object which returns <code>Optional</code>s and then, I invoke <code>calculateSomething</code>.  Therefore, if solution 1 is used the calling code would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; p1 = otherObject.getP1();\nOptional&lt;BigInteger&gt; p2 = otherObject.getP2();\nint result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);\n</code></pre>\n<p>if solution 2 is used, the calling code would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; p1 = otherObject.getP1();\nOptional&lt;BigInteger&gt; p2 = otherObject.getP2();\nint result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1.orElse(null), p2.orElse(null));\n</code></pre>\n<p>if solution 3 is applied, I could use the code above or I could use the following (but it's significantly more code):</p>\n<pre><code>Optional&lt;String&gt; p1 = otherObject.getP1();\nOptional&lt;BigInteger&gt; p2 = otherObject.getP2();\nint result;\nif (p1.isPresent()) {\n    if (p2.isPresent()) {\n        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);\n    } else {\n        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1);\n    }\n} else {\n    if (p2.isPresent()) {\n        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p2);\n    } else {\n        result = myObject.calculateSomething();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>So my question is: Why is it considered bad practice to use <code>Optional</code>s as method arguments (see solution 1)?</strong>  It looks like the most readable solution to me and makes it most obvious that the parameters could be empty/null to future maintainers.  (I'm aware the designers of <code>Optional</code> intended it to only be used as a return type, but I can't find any logical reasons not to use it in this scenario).</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>What is a good strategy for keeping <a href=\"http://ipython.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IPython</a> notebooks under version control?</p>\n\n<p>The notebook format is quite amenable for version control: if one wants to version control the notebook and the outputs then this works quite well. The annoyance comes when one wants only to version control the input, excluding the cell outputs (aka. \"build products\") which can be large binary blobs, especially for movies and plots.  In particular, I am trying to find a good workflow that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>allows me to choose between including or excluding output,</li>\n<li>prevents me from accidentally committing output if I do not want it,</li>\n<li>allows me to keep output in my local version,</li>\n<li>allows me to see when I have changes in the inputs using my version control system (i.e. if I only version control the inputs but my local file has outputs, then I would like to be able to see if the inputs have changed (requiring a commit).  Using the version control status command will always register a difference since the local file has outputs.)</li>\n<li>allows me to update my working notebook (which contains the output) from an updated clean notebook. <strong>(update)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As mentioned, if I chose to include the outputs (which is desirable when using <a href=\"http://nbviewer.ipython.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">nbviewer</a> for example), then everything is fine.  The problem is when I <em>do not</em> want to version control the output.  There are some tools and scripts for stripping the output of the notebook, but frequently I encounter the following issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I accidentally commit a version with the the output, thereby polluting my repository.</li>\n<li>I clear output to use version control, but would really rather keep the output in my local copy (sometimes it takes a while to reproduce for example).</li>\n<li>Some of the scripts that strip output change the format slightly compared to the <code>Cell/All Output/Clear</code> menu option, thereby creating unwanted noise in the diffs. This is resolved by some of the answers.</li>\n<li>When pulling changes to a clean version of the file, I need to find some way of incorporating those changes in my working notebook without having to rerun everything.\n<strong>(update)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have considered several options that I shall discuss below, but have yet to find a good comprehensive solution.  A full solution might require some changes to IPython, or may rely on some simple external scripts.  I currently use <a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mercurial</a>, but would like a solution that also works with <a href=\"https://github.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">git</a>: an ideal solution would be version-control agnostic.</p>\n\n<p>This issue has been discussed many times, but there is no definitive or clear solution from the user's perspective. The answer to this question should provide the definitive strategy.  It is fine if it requires a recent (even development) version of <a href=\"http://ipython.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IPython</a> or an easily installed extension.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have been playing with <a href=\"https://github.com/mforbes/ipython\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my modified notebook</a> version which optionally saves a <code>.clean</code> version with every save using <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/19761645/1115187\" title=\"Navigate to an answer\">Gregory Crosswhite's suggestions</a>.  This satisfies most of my constraints but leaves the following unresolved:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is not yet a standard solution (requires a modification of the ipython source.  Is there a way of achieving this behaviour with a simple extension?  Needs some sort of on-save hook.</li>\n<li>A problem I have with the current workflow is pulling changes.  These will come in to the <code>.clean</code> file, and then need to be integrated somehow into my working version.  (Of course, I can always re-execute the notebook, but this can be a pain, especially if some of the results depend on long calculations, parallel computations, etc.)  I do not have a good idea about how to resolve this yet.  Perhaps a workflow involving an extension like <a href=\"https://github.com/rossant/ipycache\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ipycache</a> might work, but that seems a little too complicated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n\n<h2>Removing (stripping) Output</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the notebook is running, one can use the <code>Cell/All Output/Clear</code> menu option for removing the output.</li>\n<li>There are some scripts for removing output, such as the script <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/minrk/6176788\" rel=\"noreferrer\">nbstripout.py</a> which remove the output, but does not produce the same output as using the notebook interface.  This was eventually included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"NBConvert on GitHub\">ipython/nbconvert</a> repo, but this has been closed stating that the changes are now included in <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"IPython on GitHub\">ipython/ipython</a>,but the corresponding functionality seems not to have been included yet.  <strong>(update)</strong> That being said, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/19761645/1115187\" title=\"Navigate to an answer\">Gregory Crosswhite's solution</a> shows that this is pretty easy to do, even without invoking <a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"NBConvert on GitHub\">ipython/nbconvert</a>, so this approach is probably workable if it can be properly hooked in.  (Attaching it to each version control system, however, does not seem like a good idea — this should somehow hook in to the notebook mechanism.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Newsgroups</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2011-November/008351.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thoughts on the notebook format for version control</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Issues</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/977#issuecomment-5558823\" rel=\"noreferrer\">977: Notebook feature requests (Open)</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1280\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1280: Clear-all on save option (Open)</a>.

I could set up a number of URIs like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/api/users     when called with GET, lists users\n/api/users     when called with POST, creates user record\n/api/users/1   when called with GET, shows user record\n               when called with PUT, updates user record\n               when called with DELETE, deletes user record\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is this a correct representation of a RESTful architecture so far?</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. I need more verbs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Create, Update and Delete may be enough in theory, but in practice I will have the need for a lot more verbs. I realize these are things that <em>could</em> be embedded in an update request, but they are specific actions that can have specific return codes and I wouldn't want to throw them all into one action.</p>\n\n<p>Some that come to mind in the user example are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>activate_login\ndeactivate_login\nchange_password\nadd_credit\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>how would I express actions such as those in a RESTful URL architecture?</p>\n\n<p>My instinct would be to do a GET call to a URL like </p>\n\n<pre><code>/api/users/1/activate_login \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and expect a status code back. </p>\n\n<p>That deviates from the idea of using HTTP verbs, though. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How to return error messages and codes</strong></p>\n\n<p>A great part of REST's beauty stems from its use of standard HTTP methods. On an error, I emit a header with a 3xx,4xx or 5xx error status code. For a detailed error description, I can use the body (right?). So far so good. But what would be the way to transmit a <strong>proprietary error code</strong> that is more detailed in describing what went wrong (e.g. \"failed to connect to database\", or \"database login wrong\")? If I put it into the body along with the message, I have to parse it out afterwards. Is there a standard header for this kind of thing?</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. How to do authentication</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What would a API key based authentication following REST principles look like?</li>\n<li>Are there strong points against using sessions when authenticating a REST client, other than that it's a blatant violation of the REST principle? :) (only half kidding here, session based authentication would play well with my existing infrastructure.)</li>\n</ul>\n",

The application always uses UTF-8 because of its multilingual nature at all levels. But opening such CSV files (containing e.g. diacritics, cyrillic letters, Greek letters) in Excel does not achieve the expected results showing something like <code>Г„/Г¤, Г–/Г¶</code>.

I also tried specifying UTF-8 BOM <code>EF BB BF</code>, but Excel ignores that.</p>\n<p>Is there any workaround?</p>\n<p>P.S. Which tools may potentially behave like Excel does?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>UPDATE</p>\n<p>I have to say that I've confused the community with the formulation of the question. When I was asking this question, I asked for a way of opening a UTF-8 CSV file in Excel without any problems for a user, in a fluent and transparent way. However, I used a wrong formulation asking for doing it <em>automatically</em>. That is very confusing and it clashes with VBA macro automation. There are two answers for this questions that I appreciate the most: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6002338/166589\">the very first answer by Alex</a>, and I've accepted this answer; <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6488070/166589\">and the second one by Mark</a> that have appeared a little later. From the usability point of view, Excel seemed to have lack of a good user-friendly UTF-8 CSV support, so I consider <em>both</em> answers are correct, and I have accepted Alex's answer first because it really stated that Excel was not able to do that transparently. That is what I confused with <em>automatically</em> here. Mark's answer promotes a more complicated way for more advanced users to achieve the expected result. Both answers are great, but Alex's one fits my not clearly specified question a little better.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>UPDATE 2</p>\n<p>Five months later after the last edit, I've noticed that Alex's answer has disappeared for some reason. I really hope it wasn't a technical issue and I hope there is no more discussion on which answer is greater now. So I'm accepting Mark's answer as the best one.</p>\n",

My first question is about the abstract factory. Is its role to allow you to create families of concrete objects in (that can depend on what specific factory you use) rather than just a single concrete object? Does the abstract factory only return one very large object or many objects depending on what methods you call?</p>\n\n<p>My final two questions are about a single quote that I cannot fully understand that I have seen in numerous places:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One difference between the two is that\n  with the Abstract Factory pattern, a\n  class delegates the responsibility of\n  object instantiation to another object\n  via composition whereas the Factory\n  Method pattern uses inheritance and\n  relies on a subclass to handle the\n  desired object instantiation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that the factory method pattern has a Creator interface that will make the ConcreteCreator be in charge of knowing which ConcreteProduct to instantiate. Is this what it means by using inheritance to handle object instantiation?</p>\n\n<p>Now with regards to that quote, how exactly does the Abstract Factory pattern delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to another object via composition? What does this mean? It looks like the Abstract Factory pattern also uses inheritance to do the construction process as well in my eyes, but then again I am still learning about these patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Any help especially with the last question, would be greatly appreciated. </p>\n",

If this is a bug in Xcode, it is a critical one!</p>\n\n<p>So, whenever I have a view hierarchy such as this I run into trouble:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;UIViewController\n&gt;&gt; UIView\n&gt;&gt;&gt;UIScrollView\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;UILabel (or any other comparable UIKit Element)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The UIScrollView has solid constraints, e.g., 50 px from every side (no problem).\nThen I add a Top Space constraint to the UILabel (no problem) (and I can even pin height / width of the label, changes nothing, but should be unneccessary due to the Label's intrinsic size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The trouble starts when I add a trailing constraint to the UILabel:</strong></p>\n\n<p>E.g., Trailing Space to: Superview Equals: 25</p>\n\n<p>Now two warnings occur - and I don't understand why:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A)</strong> Scrollable Content Size Ambiguity (Scroll View has ambiguous scrollable content height/width)</p>\n\n<p><strong>B)</strong> Misplaced Views (Label Expected: x= -67 Actual: x= 207</p>\n\n<p>I did this minimal example in a freshly new project which you can download and I attached a screenshot. As you can see, Interface Builder expects the Label to sit outside of the UIScrollView's boundary (the orange dashed rectangle). Updating the Label's frame with the Resolve Issues Tool moves it right there.</p>\n\n<p>Please note: If you replace the UIScrollView with a UIView, the behaviour is as expected (the Label's frame is correct and according to the constraint). So there seems to either be an issue with UIScrollView or I am missing out on something important.</p>\n\n<p>When I run the App without updating the Label's frame as suggested by IB it is positioned just fine, exactly where it's supposed to be and the UIScrollView is scrollable.\nIf I DO update the frame the Label is out of sight and the UIScrollView does not scroll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi! Why the ambiguous layout? Why the misplaced view?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can download the sample project here and try if you can figure out what's going on:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Wirsing84/AutoLayoutProblem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/Wirsing84/AutoLayoutProblem</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eqoUh.png\" alt=\"Illustration of the problem in Interface Builder\"></p>\n",

If someone can give me an example of how to do it, that would be great.</p>\n<p>Here is my current code:</p>\n<pre><code>package com.animation;\n\nimport android.app.Activity;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.view.animation.Animation;\nimport android.view.animation.LinearInterpolator;\nimport android.view.animation.RotateAnimation;\nimport android.widget.Button;\nimport android.widget.LinearLayout;\n\npublic class AnimateScreen extends Activity {\n\n\n//Called when the activity is first created.\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    \n    LinearLayout ll = new LinearLayout(this);\n    \n    LinearLayout.LayoutParams layoutParams = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\n    layoutParams.setMargins(30, 20, 30, 0);\n\n    Button bt = new Button(this);\n    bt.setText(String.valueOf(bt.getWidth()));\n   \n    RotateAnimation ra = new RotateAnimation(0,360,bt.getWidth() / 2,bt.getHeight() / 2);\n    ra.setDuration(3000L);\n    ra.setRepeatMode(Animation.RESTART);\n    ra.setRepeatCount(Animation.INFINITE);\n    ra.setInterpolator(new LinearInterpolator());\n\n    bt.startAnimation(ra);\n    \n    ll.addView(bt,layoutParams);\n    \n    setContentView(ll);\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
